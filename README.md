# PAM250-matrix-match
Matches your Amino acids based on PAM250 and returns the PAM score.

## Why did I make this?

We had a task during our research to find PAM250 scores for the aligned AA of homospaiens compared to other species, and it was a very exhausting task. I simply made this script to facilitate the task for me and my colleagues.

## How to run:

1. Download the code file and run it using any IDE.

2. Download the pam250 matrix and modify the directory in the code file to match it's path on your PC

"PAM250 matrix based on William R. Pearson, [5] Rapid and sensitive sequence comparison with FASTP and FASTA, Methods in Enzymology,Academic Press,Volume 183,1990,Pages 63-98, https://doi.org/10.1016/0076-6879(90)83007-V.(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/007668799083007V)"

3.Run the code.
  If you need to end the code just type " end " without quotations in the first input as the print function says.
